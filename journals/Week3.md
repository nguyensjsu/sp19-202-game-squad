### Ensuring my XP core value of Courage

I reminded our team that noone works alone. Therefore, if we have issues, we need to speak 
up about them. Our team has been very good about that. As a result, we have had 
multiple meetings on zoom in addition to our standbots and weekly Saturday face-2-face
meetings.

<h3>Chirag Arora</h3>

### Finished Last Week 
- Completed the feature which is when snake interacts with Turtle, then game should end. Made some refactoring changes to the logic such that it can integrate with other feature such as shield. 
- Helped other team members in features such as Snake Movement and Snake attraction.
- Fixed major merge conflicts in master due to which many team members were not able to merge. Pitched in to help teammates with a solution for these kind of git conflicts. Provided training on git cherry-pick.

### Planned Next Week 
- Reasearching on WOW factor (multiplayer, android application and how machine learning models can help in playing the game)
- To create sequence diagrams and other UML diagrams from the source code.

### Problems

### Ensuring my XP core value of Simplicity

Most of our features required actors to have different images at different points based on the state of the game. We spent some time thinking about editing existing images to make them look a certain way. But eventually I encouraged the team to pick the simplest images for the actors and not spend too much time editing the same thereby not focusing too much on the look of actors.

- Task 1: When snake gets killed, the count of snakes in the game needs to be adjusted
- Task 2: Integrate Snake with different patterns to make sure snake features are validated
- Task 3: Checked if composite pattern fits the story of shield for Turtle
- Task 4: Implement composite pattern so that shield and turtle moves together and can be treated as a group or individually

### Planned Next Week 
- Implement shield power system when snake hits shield
- Implement turtle kill when shield strength reaches zero
- Create UML diagrams and documentation


### Problems

- Had issues greenfoot initialising all the objects on game refresh

### Time Spent

### Ensuring my XP core value of Communication
I have ensured that our team has regular meetings whenever needed. Also that team is comfortable with the meeting timings and duration. Made sure that the owners of the inter related features discuss and solve any integration that may arise.
