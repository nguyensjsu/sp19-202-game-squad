### Ensuring my XP core value of Courage

I reminded our team that noone works alone. Therefore, if we have issues, we need to speak 
up about them. Our team has been very good about that. As a result, we have had 
multiple meetings on zoom in addition to our standbots and weekly Saturday face-2-face
meetings.
