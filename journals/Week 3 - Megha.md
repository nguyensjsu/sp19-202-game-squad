### Ensuring my XP core value of Simplicity

Most of our features required actors to have different images at different points based on the state of the game. We spent some time thinking about editing existing images to make them look a certain way. But eventually I encouraged the team to pick the simplest images for the actors and not spend too much time editing the same thereby not focusing too much on the look of actors.
