### Ensuring my XP core value of Simplicity

Since we have started development this week, a lot of features are dependent on each other and most of them are in development state. I made sure that we were stubbing dependent code and there were no blockers so that we can proceed with our development. Using this simple technique we were able to progress smoothly.
