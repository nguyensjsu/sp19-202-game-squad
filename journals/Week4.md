### Ensuring my XP core value of Courage

I reminded team that we need to adapt to changes when they happen. Like for example
we adapted as a team for ad hoc meetings this week because one team member had a 
time conflict. We also all adapted to the change that we all, in addition to 
daily Standbots, that we also have to do weekly journals. Finally, our wireframes
and uml diagrams constantly needs to be updated because of bug fixes, refactoring,
and changed features. We are adapting as a team to get the best value out of 
each sprint.
