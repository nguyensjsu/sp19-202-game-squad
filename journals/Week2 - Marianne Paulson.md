# Week 2 Scrum Report 

## Marianne Paulson

### Finished Last Week 
- Task 1: Some more research on new features and how to refactor using patterns.

- Task 2: I got my three features assigned (turtle dance, advance to next level and lady bug) and 
- created wireframes for these using Balsamic. I also created use case specifications for these.

- Task 3: 
- I spent time on process 
	-	How to use Github issue tracking
	-	How to create branching
	-	Understanding how our team was going to work on github
	-	Also learned how to effectively use Standbot on Slack for daily standups.
	-	Took the first stab at project task board (actually twice)

### Planned Next Week 
- Code my two features (dropped turtle dance)
- Create sequence diagrams for my two features
- Finetune wireframes
- Help team with process issues

### Problems

- I was not able to get the turtle to make any nice moves. Also, as a team, we did not 
  find this feature to be very valuable. Therefore, we removed this feature from the 
  backlog.

### Time Spend

- Task1: 4 hrs
- Task2: 6 hrs 
- Task 3: 4 hours

### Ensuring my XP core value of Courage

Our team is very honest so there is no issue there. However, I had to remind the team 
about improving on their estimates. When we say we will complete something by a 
certain date, we need to try our hardest to meet our estimate. Therefore, if we 
know we have a time conflict, we should be upfront about it and try and estimate
correctly.
