### Finished Last Week 
- Task 1: Some more research on new features and how to refactor using patterns.

- Task 2: I got my two stories assigned (Snake Attracted to turtle in its vicinity, Shield for Turtle) and
- created wireframes for these using Balsamic. I also created use case specifications for these.

- Task 3: Implemented speed and movement of snake and logic so that Snakes don't get too close to each other. Snake tries to repel other Snake
- I spent time on process 
	-	How to use Github issue tracking
	-	How to create branching
	-	Understanding how our team was going to work on github
	-	Also learned how to effectively use Standbot on Slack for daily standups.

### Planned Next Week 
- Code my two stories 
- Create sequence diagrams for my two stories 


### Problems

- I was not able to get the turtle to make any nice moves. Also, as a team, we did not 
  find this feature to be very valuable. Therefore, we removed this feature from the 
  backlog.
