<h1>Week 2 Scrum Report</h1>

<h2>Marianne Paulson</h2>

### Finished Last Week 
- Task 1: Some more research on new features and how to refactor using patterns.

- Task 2: I got my three features assigned (turtle dance, advance to next level and lady bug) and 
- created wireframes for these using Balsamic. I also created use case specifications for these.

- Task 3: 
- I spent time on process 
	-	How to use Github issue tracking
	-	How to create branching
	-	Understanding how our team was going to work on github
	-	Also learned how to effectively use Standbot on Slack for daily standups.
	-	Took the first stab at project task board (actually twice)

### Planned Next Week 
- Code my two features (dropped turtle dance)
- Create sequence diagrams for my two features
- Finetune wireframes
- Help team with process issues

### Problems

- I was not able to get the turtle to make any nice moves. Also, as a team, we did not 
  find this feature to be very valuable. Therefore, we removed this feature from the 
  backlog.

### Time Spend

- Task1: 4 hrs
- Task2: 6 hrs 
- Task 3: 4 hours

### Ensuring my XP core value of Courage

Our team is very honest so there is no issue there. However, I had to remind the team 
about improving on their estimates. When we say we will complete something by a 
certain date, we need to try our hardest to meet our estimate. Therefore, if we 
know we have a time conflict, we should be upfront about it and try and estimate
correctly.

<h2>Chirag Arora</h2>
### Finished Last Week 
- Wrapped up the factory pattern to create actors using multi-thread in the backgroun and using timer to control the creation of the actors
- Started looking into Turtle kill feature story and how to update the counter score board.
- Fixed some integration issues that arised in greenfoot when merging others code.

### Planned Next Week 
- Implementing initial framework for the world.
- Technical story for a design pattern. Factory Pattern. Create lady bug and different types of lettuce (green and red).
- Will be working on initial grounding work of observer pattern for Turtle kill. 

### Problems

- Got my Github account flagged. I emailed GitHub support but due to no response, creating a new account and transferring all commits under this new account. Waiting for access to our project.

### Time Spend

- Task1: 7 hrs
- Task2: 3 hrs 
- Task3: 3 hrs

### XP Core Value

All the team members were respecting each other ideas. Though respect should also be regarded in terms of time. Most of the teammembers were on time for our meetings. Reminded them to be on time.

<h2>Saumil N Patel</h2>

### Accomplished Last Week

- Task 1: We did a research on what design patterns will be suitable for the game and what features will go in the game.

- Task 2: As discussed in the team meeting, I got my 3 user stories that is Create Difficulty Levels, keep the count of snake so that we can create a new snake when snake gets killed and won the game.

- Task 3: Started creating wireframes on paper and then later moved it to Balsamic.

- Task 4: We switched from weekly standup to 3 times a week standup routine. We started using standbot in slack for standups.

- Task 5: Learn more about github to make it easier for team to work in parallel environment

### Planned Next Week

- Start working on my design pattern user story
- Finetune wireframes

### Blockers

### Time Spend

Task 1: 2 hours
Task 2: 2 hour
Task 3: 3 hours
Task 4: 3 hours
Task 5: 2 hours

<h2>Megha</h2>

### Finished Last Week

- Task 1: I got my two features assigned (Decorate Shield and Points System). Created User stories for both the assigned tasks.

- Task 2: Re-read about the decorator pattern and it's implementation. Finalized the design of Decorator on Shield.

- Task 4: Helped team with github issues

- Task 5: Worked on implementation of turtle shooting gunshots in Greenfoot

### Planned Next Week

- Finish the design pattern (Decorate Shield)
- Start implementation on the feature (Points System).
- Create sequence diagrams for my two features

### Problems

- None

### Time Spend

- Task1: 2 hrs
- Task2: 4 hrs
- Task 3: 4 hours
- Task 4: 2 hours

### Ensuring my XP core value of Simplicity

Since we have started development this week, a lot of features are dependent on each other and most of them are in development state. I made sure that we were stubbing dependent code and there were no blockers so that we can proceed with our development. Using this simple technique we were able to progress smoothly.
