## Project Name

Fun with turtles, snowmen, zombies, and much more

## Project Description

We started with a cute turtle game one of us created based on watching Michael Kolling's video series.

https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/proged/2012/01/14/joc-9/

The initial commit of code is from watching how to create this game and creating it from scratch. We then added counter and custom sounds. 

We will then refactor the code by using patterns and expand upon the features with user stories.

## Project Progress

First week was basically research and decide upon project.
We also divided up the XP values as follows:
Megha: Simplicity
Anjali: Communication
Saumil: Feedback
Marianne: Courage
Chirag: Respect

Second week we all worked on wireframes and dividing up the stories.
We also, decided who was going to refactor the game using patterns along with 
the stories we got assigned.

Once we got the stories divided, we all started to mock up screens,
draw uml diagrams, and code based on patterns and discussions.

We are now in our 3rd week and we are finetuning our stories, mockups, and uml diagrams.
We have also started on wow factor.

### Individual Contributions

Please see link to taskboard and status report

### Status Report

Status report is in the journal directory as per instructions.
The first week, we all completed a weekly report.
The weekly reports are in journals/week1 directory.

The 2nd week, we started with standbot and daily standups because we needed to catch up.
The daily standups are in daily_standups directory.
Please note that some team members felt that daily standups were a bit too much so we changed 
to Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
