## Project Name

Fun with turtles, snowmen, zombies, and much more

## Project Description

We started with Trick the Turtle - a game one of us created based on watching Michael Kolling's video series.

https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/proged/2012/01/14/joc-9/

The initial commit of code is from watching how to create this game and creating it from scratch.
We will then refactor the code by using patterns and expand upon the features.

## Project Progress

The first week we divided up the XP values as follows:
Megha: Simplicity
Anjali: Communication
Feedback: Saumil
Courage: Marianne
Respect: Chirag

We also decided upon Greenfoot and our starter game idea.
