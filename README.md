## Project Name

Fun with turtles, snowmen, zombies, and much more

## Project Description

We started with a cute turtle game one of us created based on watching Michael Kolling's video series.

https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/proged/2012/01/14/joc-9/

The initial commit of code is from watching how to create this game and creating it from scratch. We then added counter and custom sounds. 

We will then refactor the code by using patterns and expand upon the features with user stories.

## Project Progress

Every week we are improving as a team. We are trying hard to follow the values of XP.
Each of us is responsible for one value each as shown below.

Megha: Simplicity
Anjali: Communication
Saumil: Feedback
Marianne: Courage
Chirag: Respect

We have found that following these values, make us work better together as a team.

As we are approaching end of week 3, we have now completed completed wireframing, diagramming, coding, testing, and integration of 9 out of 10 user stories.

We are optimistic that we will finish all 10 stories by end of this week.

We have also managed to port our Turtleworld game to an Android phone. We are working 
on completing this by mid next week.

Finally, we have started working on the ad for our TurtleWorld Game.

### Individual Contributions

Please see link to taskboard and status report

### Status Report

Status report is in the journal directory as per instructions.
The first week, we all completed a weekly report.
The weekly reports are in journals/week1 directory.

The 2nd week, we started with standbot and daily standups because we needed to catch up.
The daily standups are in daily_standups directory.
Please note that some team members felt that daily standups were a bit too much so we changed 
to Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
