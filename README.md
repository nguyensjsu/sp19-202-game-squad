## Project Name

TurtleWorld

## Project Description

We started with a cute turtle game one of us created based on watching Michael Kolling's video series.

https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/proged/2012/01/14/joc-9/

The initial commit of code is from watching how to create this game and creating it from scratch. We then added counter, custom sounds, and experimented with the Greenfoot UI.

We then refactored the code into patterns taught in class.

Finally, we came up with 10 user stories and implemented all 10 features. We picked two features each.

## Project Progress

We divided the XP values as shown below

-   Megha: Simplicity
-   Anjali: Communication
-   Saumil: Feedback
-   Marianne: Courage
-   Chirag: Respect

Each week we improve as a team by practicing these values. This is documented in the following progress sections.

Please note, that we started with weekly progress report. Then, as we got behind schedule, we decided to change from weekly format to three-times-a-week format. This helped us get back on track.

As a result, we have 2 different formats for progress

- Week 1:   Weekly format
- Week 2-4: Standbot format 

On Saturday April 13th we decided to have daily standups on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

### Week 1 - Researching and Learning

XP values and how we practiced them this week is explained in next section

#### Week 1 - Exercising the XP values

We met at the library the first week to discuss user stories. It was nice to meet face to face.
We exercised the value of simplicity by suggesting basic features for our game and avoiding getting 
into too much detail. We listened to everyone's suggestions and gave feedback. We also discussed 
the importance of respecting eachother and have courage to speak up about anything. Lastly, because 4 out of 5 have full time work, we decided to have multiple ways of communicating:

- Use our private Slack channel setup by professor on March 30th.
- Use Zoom for adhoc meetings
- Meet face to face every Saturday
- Individual phone calls when needed

We left the meeting with a good foundation for how we would work together as a team.

### Week 2 - User stories

XP values and how we practiced them this week is explained in next section

#### Week 2 - Exercising the XP values

As noted in the progress introduction section, we experienced this week that weekly status is not enough. We also needed an easier way to provide status.

As a result, one of us came up with the idea of using Standbot tool in Slack. We then got approval from Professor to use this tool.

As noted in progress introductory section, we decided to have weekly status every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. We respected everyone's busy agendas and gave every team member a large time window to provide status. Using Standbot helped with simplicity.

Switching to Standbot also helped with quicker feedback.

As far as communication, we meet over zoom twice this week to discuss a couple of the stories. We also met at the library on Saturday for four hours.

We exercised courage by reminding everyone to be honest about progress and task estimations.

### Week 3 - Finetuning stories and Wow Factor

XP values and how we practiced them this week is explained in next section

#### Week 3 - Exercising the XP values

We had some communication difficulties this week due to work emergencies, etc. We overcome this by shuffling some tasks around. Again, we also met face to face on Saturday which is always nice. Again, we met at the library.

As far as simplicity and feedback, we converted our pencil drawn mockup screens to a tool called Balsamic. It was so much easier to get feedback on the screens this week. We gave each teammeber write access to update the wireframes. 

We also reminded eachother this week to be more prompt with replies and feedback while respecting each team member's situation and circumstances.

### Week 4 - Wrapping up and including Wow Factor

XP values and how we practiced them this week is explained in next section

#### Week 4 - Exercising the XP values

We met after class on Saturday to discuss the work of this last sprint. It is always best to meet face to face. Again, we are good about respecting each team member's situation with regard to special circumstances which require us to shuffle tasks and reschedule meeting.

We met over zoom on Sunday.
