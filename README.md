<h2>Project Name</h2>

<h3>TurtleWorld</h3>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

We started with a cute turtle game one of us created based on watching Michael Kolling's video series.

https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/proged/2012/01/14/joc-9/

The initial commit of code is from watching how to create this game and creating it from scratch. We then added counter, custom sounds, and experimented with the Greenfoot UI.

We then refactored the code into patterns taught in class.

Finally, we came up with 10 user stories and implemented all 10 features. We picked two features each.
